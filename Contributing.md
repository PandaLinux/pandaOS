# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing

We want people to test our builds on different linux systems and report all the issues to make the installer more robust.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). When you send a pull request. We can always use more test coverage. Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
